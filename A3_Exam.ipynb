        "Marketing or advertising companies would be very interested in being able to predict whether a Twitter message will spread as a meme or not, and even better, construct it so that it will spread. Why is this a hard problem to solve? Describe two appraoches using data analytics to predict whether a tweet will go viral or not. How would you validate these approaches? Discuss the ethical and social consequence of this study.\n"
